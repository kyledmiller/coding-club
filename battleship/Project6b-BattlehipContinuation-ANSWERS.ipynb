        "2.   Place ships on the board (*Function 2: Placing ships* and *Function 3: Filling the board with ships*)\n",
        "3.   Allow the player to guess where ships are (*Function 4: Attack*).\n",
        "\n",
        "Similar to lesson 6a, first we'll start with a 10x10 board made of zeros, and 10 ships that are of length 1 randomly placed on the board (you can save ships as ones). Next, allow the user to select the space they want to attack.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the turns, use a loop to allow the user to guess until all the ships are hit. If all ships are hit, print that the user won the game. Print the board in between each turn.\n",
