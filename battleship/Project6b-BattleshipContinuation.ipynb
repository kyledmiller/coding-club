The full program has three main compononents:\n","\n","1.   Set up the board as a 2D matrix (*Function 1: Making the board*)\n","2.   Place ships on the board (*Function 2: Placing ships* and *Function 3: Filling the board with ships*)\n","3.   Allow the player to guess where ships are (*Function 4: Attack*).\n","\n","Similar to lesson 6a, first we'll start with a 10x10 board made of zeros, and 10 ships that are of length 1 randomly placed on the board (you can save ships as ones). Next, allow the user to select the space they want to attack.\n","\n","For the turns, use a loop to allow the user to guess until all the ships are hit. If all ships are hit, print that the user won the game. Print the board in between each turn.\n","\n","You can use code from the previous lesson, modified to fit the requirements above. **You are encouraged to open your lesson 6a and copy and paste your past functions into this lesson.**\n","\n","\n","Below are some example outputs of the program.\n","\n","\n","```\n","Let's play Battleship!\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","Turn\n","Guess Row:3\n","Guess Col:1\n","You missed my battleship!\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O X O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","Turn\n","Guess Row:6\n","Guess Col:4\n","Oops, that's not even in the ocean.\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O X O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","Turn\n","Guess Row:7\n","Guess Col:8\n","Oops, that's not even in the ocean.\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O X O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","Turn\n","Guess Row:5\n","Guess Col:1\n","You missed my battleship!\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O X O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O X O O O O\n","Turn\n","Guess Row:5\n","Guess Col:3\n","You missed my battleship!\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O X O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O X O X O O\n","Turn\n","Guess Row:6\n","Guess Col:1\n","Oops, that's not even in the ocean.\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O X O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O X O X O O\n","Turn\n","Guess Row:4\n","Guess Col:4\n","You missed my battleship!\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O X O O O O\n","O O O O X O\n","O X O X O O\n","Turn\n","Guess Row:1\n","Guess Col:1\n","You missed my battleship!\n","O O O O O O\n","O X O O O O\n","O O O O O O\n","O X O O O O\n","O O O O X O\n","O X O X O O\n","Turn\n","Guess Row:2\n","Guess Col:2\n","You missed my battleship!\n","Game Over\n","O O O O O O\n","O X O O O O\n","O O X O O O\n","O X O O O O\n","O O O O X O\n","O X O X O O\n","```\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"NaFP0WeHhBdr"},"source":["# WRITE PROGRAM HERE\n","\n","# Start by importing the necessary libraries, copying functions from lesson 6a, \n","# and testing to see if they work.
