Your bonus challenge is to write a new `make_board` function that creates an official size Battleship board and places the correct number of correctly-sized ships (refer to the Wikipedia page) with locations of those ships **chosen by the user**. \n","\n","**Tips**\n","1. Since this board is a 2D grid, you should ask the user for **3 pieces of information** when placing a ship for them: x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and orientation (vertical or horizontal).\n","\n","\n","2. To simplify placement of variably-sized ships in varying orientations (vertical and horizontal), you should use the uppermost, leftmost segment of the ship as the reference point for where it is placed on the board. For example, if a user asks to place a 3-long ship horizontally at (x=1, y=2), the ship will be placed at coordinates (1,2), (2,2), (3,2). This consistency makes it easier to check if the ship being placed will collide with other ships or fall off the board.\n","\n","\n","3. It is somewhat complicated to give the user a second chance if they place a ship in the wrong location so we will instead create an unforgiving program that simply throws away that ship if the user makes a mistake. >:)\n","\n","\n","4.
