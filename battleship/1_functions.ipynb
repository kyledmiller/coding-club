They allow us to simplify and shorten our program by encapsulating useful pieces of code so that we can reuse it throughout our program without rewriting the same code. You can think of it as a variable but instead of simply saving an object for later use, we are saving a process for later use.\n",

    "Every function has 4 basic components:\n",
    "1. **Name**: a short, descriptive name for the function which should be lowercase with words separated by underscores, e.g., `clear_board` for a function that removes all pieces from a game board\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Arguments**: the input of the function, or the information that the function needs to carry out its process. A function can have any number of arguments, even zero if no input information is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return value**: the output of the function, or the finished product created by the function's process. Not every function needs to have a return value, e.g., `set_height` might change a value in an object but doesn't need to produce value whereas `get_height` which retrieves an object's height should return the height value. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
