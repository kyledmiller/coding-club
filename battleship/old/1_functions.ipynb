    "Every function has 5 basic components:\n",
    "1. **Name**: a short, descriptive name for the function which should be lowercase with words separated by underscores, e.g., `clear_board` for a function that removes all pieces from a game board\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Arguments**: the input of the function, or the information that the function needs to carry out its process. A function can have any number of arguments, even zero if no input information is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comment**: a description of the function, its arguments, and its return values. This is technically not required for a function to work but it crucial for others to understand your code and helpful for you to outline your own code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Body**: the code inside a function that carries out the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return value**: the output of the function, or the finished product created by the function's process. Not every function needs to have a return value, e.g., `set_height` might change a value in an object but doesn't need to produce value whereas `get_height` which retrieves an object's height should return the height value.

    "These functions are nice but Battleship isn't that fun if all the ships are the same size (1x1)! Your bonus challenge is to write a new `make_board` function that creates an official size Battleship board and places the correct number of correctly-sized ships (refer to the Wikipedia page) **according to user input**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips**\n",
    "1. Since this board is a 2D grid, you should ask the user for **3 pieces of information** when placing a ship for them: x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and orientation (vertical or horizontal).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To simplify placement of variably-sized ships in varying orientations (vertical and horizontal), you should use the uppermost, leftmost segment of the ship as the reference point for where it is placed on the board. For example, if a user asks to place a 3-long ship horizontally at (x=1, y=2), the ship will be placed at coordinates (1,2), (2,2), (3,2). This consistency makes it easier to check if the ship being placed will collide with other ships or fall off the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It is somewhat complicated to give the user a second chance if they place a ship in the wrong location so we will instead create an unforgiving program that simply throws away that ship if the user makes a mistake. >:)\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Knowing some advanced looping keywords will be useful. Read this [article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-break-continue-and-pass-statements-when-working-with-loops-in-python-3) if you are unfamiliar with `break`, `continue`, and `pass`."
