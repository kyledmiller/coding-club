        "4. **Body**: the code inside a function that carries out the process.\n",

        "\n",
        "5. **Return value**: the output of the function, or the finished product created by the function's process. Not every function needs to have a return value, e.g., `set_height` might change a value in an object but doesn't need to produce value whereas `get_height` which retrieves an object's height should return the height value.

        "2. To simplify placement of variably-sized ships in varying orientations (vertical and horizontal), you should use the uppermost, leftmost segment of the ship as the reference point for where it is placed on the board. For example, if a user asks to place a 3-long ship horizontally at (x=1, y=2), the ship will be placed at coordinates (1,2), (2,2), (3,2). This consistency makes it easier to check if the ship being placed will collide with other ships or fall off the board.\n",
